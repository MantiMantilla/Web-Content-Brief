# Interview questions

## Projects - Analytics Educational Web Content and Remote Python Environments

### What is it?

Developed a series of educational web content and web services for various subjects in Mathematics, Economics, and Data Science and analytics.

All content was designed to be agnostic to the progress of its respective courses and meant to be completely FOSS. A student with little prior knowledge should be able to incrementally read through the interactive content and become well versed in the subject.

### What was my role?

As lead developer for this series of web content, I was in charge of assembling the technology stack with which we would develop the website, as well as producing most of the content on the websites themselves. It was my responsibility to review and guide my colleagues' work to match the stylistic guidelines and to ensure compatibility with the stack, as well as keeping in contact with teachers and administrative staff to track the scope and progress of the project and for feedback on our teams outcomes.

### How did I do it?

Probably the most important action I took to make the projects come along, was educating my peers in the technology stack and setting efficient communication channels and practices to ensure the quality of our results. Setting up my team for success and trusting that they would deliver appropriately was key in completing these large-scale projects.

### What tools did I use?

Because these were software development projects we relied on tools for collaborative coding, version control, and development environment standirdization.

* Git
* Github
* Conda

The website itself was built using mostly Python and R tools along with some web development essentials:

* Python
* R
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Sphynx (static web content builder)
* Jupyter Book
* R Bookdown
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The content covers a wide variety of topics, all of which take a practical approach to programming, and so we had to become seasoned experts in the use of several libraries and software tools specific to the field we were hoping to expose.

* Mathematical Optimization:
    - Python
    - Numpy / Pandas
    - PuLP
    - Gurobi
    - Matplotlib

* Statistics and Analytics
    - Python / R
    - Numpy / Pandas
    - Matplotlib / Seaborn
    - Plotly
    - ipywidgets / panel
    - PySpark / SQL
    - scikit-learn
    - statsmodels

The websites were also reliant on interactive python environments provided through the internent, and so we leveraged tools from the context of DevOps.

* Linux Servers
* Bash scripts
* Github Actions
* Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)
* JupyterHub
* Azure VMs

Aside from the tech stack, we were also reliant on productivity tools such as very rudimentary progress trackers, scheduling, and remote meetings software.

### Results

Our target users for these projects was twofold. On one hand, it was a requirement that Professors be able to leverage the content on the websites to teach their courses, such that they would follow a consistent structure and a steady pace, which meant we had to keep the goals of the courses in mind during development. On the other hand, the content was meant for students to consume and follow along to, meaning we had to satisfy several requirements and resolve conflicts efficiently.

In the end, the results speak for themselves. These projects are now an integral part of several courses both at an undergraduate and postgraduate level, with several student testimonies claiming these tools were essential for their enjoyment and success. The websites have now accompanied courses on several iterations, each of which has allowed the consistent evolution of the project, which to this day continues to expand.

These websites have now been used by close to 1000 students from the courses we are aware of, but also several more from how everything is accessible on the internet, free of charge and with the freedom to redistribute.

### The team

Each of these websites was developed with different teams, with me at the lead of the projects. Most of us were members of the teaching staff of the courses for which the content was developed, while some were students who had already taken the courses and were experiencing software development and academia for the firs time. At a point when the project was particularly successful, we were working in collaboration with the administrative staff at the university to make the technology more accessible to a wider audience. To this day, the project keeps growing with new content being delivered.
